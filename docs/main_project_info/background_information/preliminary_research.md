# Preliminary Research
During our pre-research phase, we did not find many sources, which was both a motivation and a demotivation in that our subject is not overdone, but we also did not have a lot of inspiration to work from.

## Automatic Wordfeud Playing Bot
one source we made good use of, is the [report][report_MB&FE] of a bachelor thesis by Martin Berntsson and Fredric Ericsson at the Royal Institute of Technology KTH in Sweden. They built a bot which followed the strategy of picking the move which resulted in the highest score in the current turn, what we call 'greedy'. The pseudo-code for the algorithm in the report was implemented in our bot code, forming the base of all types of bots we have produced. [(Berntsson & Ericsson, 2010)][report_MB&FE]
