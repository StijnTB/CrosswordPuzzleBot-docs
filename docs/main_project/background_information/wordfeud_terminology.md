# Wordfeud Terminology

There are a few terms used quite a lot in this project concerning the game of Wordfeud itself.
* Tilerow: Both players have a row of at most seven tiles at any point during the game. They can use these tiles to play words on the board.
* Tilebag: The players both receive tiles from the tilebag to have their number of tiles stay at seven. When the tilebag has less tiles left than a player needs to bring him back to seven tiles, the player will receive the remaining tiles in the tilebag.
* Tile: A tile can refer to two things:
    * A tile with a letter which is used by players to play words.
    * A tile on the board which is a place where the player can put a tile to play it.
* Bonus tile: On the board, there are certain tiles which, when a letter is played on it, give the player a bonus depending on its type. These bonus tiles have a special colour and letters on them.
    * Double Word: Doubles the value of the entire word played. On the board, this tile says "DW".
    * Triple Word: Triples the value of the entire word played. On the board, this tile says "TW".
    * Double Letter: Doubles the value of the letter played on the tile. On the board, this tile says "DL".
    * Triple Letter: Triples the value of the letter played on the tile. On the board, this tile says "TL".
* Centre tile: The tile at the centre of the board. In the first turn, the player is required to have one of the letters played on this tile.
* Bingo: A player can play a bingo when they play all seven of their tiles in one turn. When this happens, the player receives a bonus to their base score of forty points.
